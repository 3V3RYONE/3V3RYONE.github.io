Summary: Writing an Automation script in python with the help of Selenium

So I participated in a hackathon organized by **Solartis** in 2020. And my project was to write an Automation script that could extract the data of 51 people and fill an insurance form for each of them and download their confirmation recipts successfully.  
  
The problem statement definition is given below.

This is the [link](https://enrollmentdemo.solartis.net/Quote.xhtml) to the demo insurnace site. As you can see, it is really tedious to write the data of 51 people one by one in the site and generate the recipts. Hence, automation script is the solution for it.
  
###Automation Scripts
What an automation program does is that it automates your work. You just have to run the script and sit back and see how fast it gets the job done. One example would be logging into facebook. You can just give your email/phone and password once in the code and you can literally login into fb under 3 seconds for the rest of your lifetime :). You now don't have to open your browser, search into facebook, type your email and password and get logged in. You just have to run the program and it does all of this for you in seconds. So, automation scripts can be used for all things that you do repeatedly in a day, like paying bills online, opening up mails, buying your cart on amazon and what not!  
  
So coming back to the project, I created an Excel sheet containing the data of 51 people from 51 states of the USA, obviously fake. And I wrote the automation program in python and used **selenium** for automation. Selenium is basically a package that enables you to do automation. The program used **Openpyxl** to extract the data from the Excel sheet and use it in the site. Openpyxl is another package that enables the program to access the data from an Excel sheet based on the row and coloumn value.  
  
I have attached the link to my github repository which contains the code and the excel sheet. Don't worry, I have also listed out the packages required for running this code in the Readme file :)

So the whole project can be simply thought of as an way of data transmission, with the Excel sheet being the source, the website being the destination and the automation script being the superfast transmission medium. :)
