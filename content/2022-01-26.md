Summary:  When was the last time you envisioned yourself as a tiny particle? Long ago, huh? No problems, let me take you on a Quantum leap today. 

The physics which we are well aware of, that govern the working and motion of macroscopic bodies is called Classical physics. These are the laws of motion, force, work and energy that we have been studying all the time along. It may explain our all day-to-day activities, from walking on our shoes to the Moon's rotation around Earth. But once we dive into the quantum level, none of these laws hold good. We have a totally different set of rules that control the working of microscopic or even smaller particles, which is known as Quantum Physics. So, lets dive into the quantum world eh!
