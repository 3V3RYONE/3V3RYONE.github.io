##If you don't realize a **Déjà vu**, you have to realize you are creating a **Déjà vu**!    


Hii there!  
I'm Beleswar. I am an undergrad CS student who loves to code and create.  
I like to explore new technologies. Fond of quantum mechanics, mysteries, paradox and time.
This blog recites my thoughts, findings and techs.

Thanks for stopping by! :)
