And my project was to write an Automation script that could extract the data of 51 people and fill an insurance form for each of them and download their confirmation recipts successfully.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem statement definition is given below.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img alt="statement" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;amp;id=164hlmMz7W2kLFqNLz1RHn4Yo8HDbXLiH"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;a href="https://enrollmentdemo.solartis.net/Quote.xhtml"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to the demo insurnace site. As you can see, it is really tedious to write the data of 51 people one by one in the site and generate the recipts. Hence, automation script is the solution for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Automation Scripts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What an automation program does is that it automates your work. You just have to run the script and sit back and see how fast it gets the job done. One example would be logging into facebook. You can just give your email/phone and password once in the code and you can literally login into fb under 3 seconds for the rest of your lifetime :). You now don't have to open your browser, search into facebook, type your email and password and get logged in. You just have to run the program and it does all of this for you in seconds. So, automation scripts can be used for all things that you do repeatedly in a day, like paying bills online, opening up mails, buying your cart on amazon and what not!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So coming back to the project, I created an Excel sheet containing the data of 51 people from 51 states of the USA, obviously fake. And I wrote the automation program in python and used &lt;strong&gt;selenium&lt;/strong&gt; for automation. Selenium is basically a package that enables you to do automation. The program used &lt;strong&gt;Openpyxl&lt;/strong&gt; to extract the data from the Excel sheet and use it in the site. Openpyxl is another package that enables the program to access the data from an Excel sheet based on the row and coloumn value.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have attached the link to my github repository which contains the code and the excel sheet. Don't worry, I have also listed out the packages required for running this code in the Readme file :)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/3V3RYONE/Solartis-Web-Automation"&gt;Github repo link&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the whole project can be simply thought of as an way of data transmission, with the Excel sheet being the source, the website being the destination and the automation script being the superfast transmission medium. :)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="TECH"></category><category term="Web Automation"></category><category term="Selenium"></category></entry><entry><title>Schrödinger's cat</title><link href="https://3v3ryone.github.io/schrodingers-cat.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-12-22T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2020-12-22T00:00:00+05:30</updated><author><name>Beleswar</name></author><id>tag:3v3ryone.github.io,2020-12-22:/schrodingers-cat.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Defining the Schrödinger's cat paradox&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h3&gt;What is a paradox?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A paradox is like a snake eating its own tail. You don't know how or where the thing starts or ends. Consider this,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are 20 years old. You met with an old man today. After few days,you realised that man is the older form of you(from 2080).
So how do you define this? Is it you meeting with your older form today or is it you living 80 years then meeting your younger form?
Where did it start?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confused? It's normal.I would recommend watching the movie &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=predestination&amp;amp;oq=predestination+++&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0i20i131i263i433i457j46i433j0j0i433j0l2j0i131i433.3204j0j7&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8"&gt;predestination&lt;/a&gt;. Its worth the time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Schrödinger's cat&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It came as a thought of Erwin Schrödinger while discussing with Albert Einstein about Quantum mechanics.&lt;br&gt;
Consider a setup where you put a cat, a flask containing hydrocyanic acid(poisonous), a hammer and a radioactive sample in a &lt;strong&gt;sealed&lt;/strong&gt; box for one hour.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="setup" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Schrodingers_cat.svg/640px-Schrodingers_cat.svg.png"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of radioactive substance is so less that within an hour, there is &lt;strong&gt;equal probability&lt;/strong&gt; that only one atom decays or none of the atoms decays.&lt;br&gt;
If that one atom decays, it releases the hammer that breaks the flask of poison. The cat inhales the poison and dies.If no atom decays, the cat is still alive.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Quantum physics states that both the situations are happening simultaneously, that is, the cat is both dead and alive, &lt;strong&gt;in multiple realities&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
In one reality, the cat is lying dead and in the other, the cat is alive.This is called &lt;strong&gt;Quantum superposition&lt;/strong&gt; just like wave superposition.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system stops being a superposition of realities only when an &lt;strong&gt;observation&lt;/strong&gt; is made. That is, only when the box is opened after an hour, the two realities collapse into one of the reality and we see either a dead cat or an alive cat.This establishes the so called &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;parallel universe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. That is, when the box is not yet opened,if in one universe the cat is alive, in the parallel universe the cat is dead and vice versa.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Classical mechanics says whether or not the observation is made, there is only one possibility. Either the cat is dead or its alive.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a moment and realise the beauty of this! :)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="THOUGHTS"></category><category term="Quantum mechanics"></category><category term="parallel universe"></category></entry></feed>
